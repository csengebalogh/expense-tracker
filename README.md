# README

Simple expense tracker application made with React and React Hooks.

Note that the source code is from https://github.com/bradtraversy/expense-tracker-react

This code might differ slightly from the original final version, I tried to figure out several things alone and I might have come up with different solutions for some problems.

I'm currently working on this as a coding project or challenge, once it's complete and functional, I have multiple ideas on what I want to add as extras, maybe build a nice front-end to practice that as well.

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
